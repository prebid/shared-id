# Google Secure Signal Collector Script

## Installation

The Shared ID Google Deploy Secure Signals script is deprecated in favor of the Prebid User ID method. Please adjust your GAM Secure Signals settings. Previous versions of this script may or may not function as intended. They may have some unusual side effects. If you are using Prebid.js, the newer method is maintained. If you are not using Prebid, GAM now supports generating its own id analogous to the shared id for AdX requests, or may ingest the GA id. See https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/10488752?hl=en&ref_topic=10728657&sjid=15896989004232235718-NA and https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/14082205 for additional detail. Many Prebid publishers have found success using the sharedid as the GAM ppid.
